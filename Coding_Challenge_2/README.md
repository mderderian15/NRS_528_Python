# **Coding Challenge 2**
## **Covering the Basics**
### This coding challenge covers **five** basic components of Python. By completing five these five tasks, this assignment will cover *list values*, *list overlaps*, *count occurrences*, and *user inputs*.
For the first task, I created a list that contained *all elements that were less than five* and printed the list.
In the second task I determined which words were present in *both lists* and which words *do not overlap* in them. For the third task I counted the *occurrence* of each word in a string. 
For tasks four and five, the challenge was to create code that **gave an output based on the user's input**. The fourth task has the user input their age and then print how many years they have left until retirement **if the user retires at 65 years old**. The fifth task was to create a dictionary that will **calculate scrabble scores** based on the user's input word.
