# Coding Challenge 9
## Using the arcpy.da module

For this challenge, our assignment was to use the **Forest Health Works** dataset and extract all sites that have a photo
of the invasive species and create two new shapefiles. One with the records that **contain photos** and one for the records that **do not contain photos**. 

After creating this shapefile, we were to create code that counted how many records contain photos and how many do not contain photos.
We were also to count how many unique species there were in the entire dataset.
