# Coding Challenge 5
## Creating Heat Maps
For this coding challenge, our job was to generate a **heat map** for the species *Cepphus grylle* using a CSV file.
In order to generate this heat map, we first had to create a fishnet grid to build the heat map off of. 
After creating the heat map, we were able to show the variation by dividing the symbology into classes into ArcGIS Pro
to look at distribution.
