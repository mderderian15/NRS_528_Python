# Coding Challenge 10
## Calculating NDVI

For this task, our job was to calculate the NDVI index from Landsat 8 imagery for the year of 2015.
The NDVI for each month provided was required, as well as providing a layout of an area we found interesting
during the months provided (6 layouts total). 

The only requirement for this assignment was that the NDVI had to be calculayed for each month only using one run of the code.
