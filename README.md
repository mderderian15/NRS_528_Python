# Hello! My name is Michaela Derderian.
## Welcome to my NRS 528 repository
I am originally from _Upstate New York_ but now live in _Rhode Island_
I am earning my __Masters of Environmental Science and Management__ from the __University of Rhode Island__

I have heard this class is *challenging*, but I hope to learn a lot and become more comfortable with ***Python***
