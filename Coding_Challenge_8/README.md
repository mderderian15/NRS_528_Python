# Coding Challenge 8
## Working with Functions
Our challenge for this assignment was to take code from a previous coding challenge and turn it into a function.
Our only requirements were to make multiple changes to our inputs, to have our function take at least two arguments,
and to provide example data with our code. 

For this challenge, I took the Natural Heritage Areas data from RIGIS I had previously used and created a function to 
describe the shapefile type (point, line, or polygon) and to describe the spatial reference of the data (whether or not the spatial reference was WGS 84).
