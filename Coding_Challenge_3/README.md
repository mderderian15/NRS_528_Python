# Coding Challenge 3
## Modules
### This coding challenge includes three separate tasks called *Simple directory tree*, *Push sys.argv to the limit*, and *Working with CSV*.

For the **first** task, the challenge was to create a **directory tree** within my computer's operating system like the one shown below:

├── draft_code
|   ├── pending
|   └── complete
├── includes
├── layouts
|   ├── default
|   └── post
|       └── posted
└── site

We had to create this directory tree using os.system or os.mkdirs and then delete the tree from our operating system.

For the **second** task, the purpose was to construct a Python script that takes a inputs as a command from a .bat file using sys.argv
After creating a minimum of three arguments in 15 lines or less, I printed the produced output.

For the **third** task, we had to use the **Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Dry Air Mole Fractions from quasi-continuous daily measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii** CSV file to 
calculate the **annual average** for each year in the dataset, calculate the **minimum**, **maximum**, and **average** for the entire dataset, and
calculate the **anomaly** for each value in the dataset relative to the mean for the entire time series.
