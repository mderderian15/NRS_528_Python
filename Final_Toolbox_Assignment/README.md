# Final Toolbox Assignment
## Creating a Python Toolbox

The task for this assignment was to create a Python Toolbox that contains a minimum of three tools that use geoprocessing and file management operations.

My tools are part of a larger workflow and are three separate functions that use the same data to create a single final product. 

In my toolbox, I have created a Select tool, a Buffer tool, and a Clip tool. These three tools will use Conservation Lands Data and Municipalities Data from RIGIS. The data is provided in this repository.
