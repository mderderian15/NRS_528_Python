# Coding Challenge 4
## Using Arcpy

For this task, we had to **run an ArcGIS tool using arcpy**. I chose the ***Erase analysis*** for this task.
I also created a base path from my directory to facilitate use between users by changing only having to change 
a **single variable**.

We also had to provide example data to run this task, so I chose the Natural Hertiage Areas layer and the Municipalities layer from RIGIS.
I wrote my code so that any natural heritage areas within the North Kingstown boundary would be erased.
